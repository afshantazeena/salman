				<h2>Vaccination is very safe and effective </h2>
				<p class="text-danger text-justify">Vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals.</p>
				<p>Vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or tenderness at the site of injection but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and trauma of the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare. The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.</p>
